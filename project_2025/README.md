# Project Assignment: Short Video Recommender System (KuaiRec)

## Objective

Develop a recommender system that suggests short videos to users based on user preferences, interaction histories, and video content using the **KuaiRec dataset**. The challenge is to create a personalised and scalable recommendation engine similar to those used in platforms like TikTok or Kuaishou.

## Dataset

We will use the **KuaiRec dataset**, a large-scale, fully-observed dataset collected from the Kuaishou short-video platform.

It contains:

- **User interactions** (views, likes, etc.)
- **Video metadata** (video ID, tags, etc.)
- **Timestamps**

More info: [KuaiRec Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10842)

The dataset will be preprocessed and provided in this format:

- `interactions_train.csv`: historical user-item interactions for training.
- `interactions_test.csv`: user-item pairs to score during testing.
- `sample_submission.csv`: a template showing the expected output format.
- `video_metadata.csv`: metadata including tags or content-related features.

### Download the dataset

You can download the dataset via a wget command:

```bash
wget https://nas.chongminggao.top:4430/datasets/KuaiRec.zip --no-check-certificate
unzip KuaiRec.zip
```

### Dataset description

KuaiRec contains millions of user-item interactions as well as side information including the item categories and a social network. Six files are included in the download data:

```bash
KuaiRec
  â”œâ”€â”€ data
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ big_matrix.csv          
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ small_matrix.csv
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ social_network.csv
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ user_features.csv
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ item_daily_features.csv
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ item_categories.csv
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ kuairec_caption_category.csv
```

## Tasks

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Load and inspect the dataset.
   - Handle missing or inconsistent data.
   - Merge metadata for content-based models if necessary.

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Create meaningful features from interaction and metadata (e.g., content tags, user activity history).
   - Build user-item interaction matrix.
   - Optionally extract time-based or popularity-based features.

3. **Model Development**
   - Choose a recommendation approach:
     - Collaborative filtering (e.g., ALS, Matrix Factorisation)
     - Content-based filtering
     - Sequence-aware models
     - Hybrid approaches
   - Train and validate your model on the training set.

4. **Recommendation Algorithm**
   - Predict which videos are likely to be enjoyed by each user in the test set.
   - Generate a top-N ranked list of recommendations for each user.

5. **Evaluation**
   - Choose suitable metrics (e.g., Precision@K, Recall@K, MAP, NDCG).
   - Evaluate performance and provide interpretations.

**Important note**: This project leaves room for creativity. Different students might take different paths in preprocessing, modelling, and evaluation. What matters is your ability to justify each step with solid reasoning.

## Deliverables

I expect you to send me an email with a link to your GitHub repo. If the repo is private, please add me as a collaborator.

- **Code**: Well-documented code in a GitHub repository. Submit a *link* to the repo.
- **Report**: A detailed README.md explaining the methodology, experiments, results, and conclusions.

**Important Note**: Please name your repo as `FinalProject_2025_<your_name>`. Not your GitHub username, or your nickname, use your real name, otherwise it will be hard for me to find your repo.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Functionality**: Does your recommender provide high-quality and relevant video suggestions?
- **Accuracy**: Did you choose meaningful metrics? How well does the model perform according to them?
- **Documentation**: Clear, organised code and explanations of each design choice.

This final project is designed to mimic real-world recommender system challenges. Itâ€™s your chance to build something scalable and practical. Good luck! ðŸš€
